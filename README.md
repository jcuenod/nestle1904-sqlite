# Why Python2?

Great question! Because I couldn't be bothered to rewrite `rptag.py` (taken from <https://github.com/morphgnt/tischendorf/blob/master/code/rptag.py>). Ulrik Sandborg-Peterson has used the Robinson-Pierpont tagging system which, I think, is why that's the system used in Nestle1904. It's just a lot harder to parse stuff out the codes because code columns change meaning depending on the type of word. Anyway, that's why this project is written in python2. I'm lazy...
